## Hiya! üëã

Thanks for checking out my implementation of this front-end coding challenge, [Frontend Mentor Single price card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc/hub).

I've been so busy with online classes mainly from [Girl Develop It!](https://girldevelopit.com/) and totally recommend you check them out! 

But it feels so long since I worked on a project of my own. I had a few free hours, and decided to check out challenges I hadn't finished.  I can't emphasize enough how good it felt to be coding again! üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### What I learned

1) I had forgotten how to center something! ü§£
![The classic CSS meme](images/centering.png)
The issue that was hanging me up was setting the following on `html` **and** `body`:

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
body {
  position: relative;
}
.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm continuing a systematic study of **DSA**'s, where I'm being *language agnostic* using **JavaScript**, **Python** & **Elixir**.
